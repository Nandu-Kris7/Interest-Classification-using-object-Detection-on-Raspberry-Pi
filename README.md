# Interest-Classification-using-object-Detection-on-Raspberry-Pi
 This project analyzes human behavior to classify a person's interest level—"Interested" or "Not Interested"—using computer vision and machine learning on a Raspberry Pi. The system leverages OpenCV, MediaPipe, and TensorFlow Lite to detect facial expressions, eye gaze, and body posture in real time. 

## Why is this project important?

Understanding human engagement is crucial in multiple fields. This project can be applied to:
Education: Helps teachers and online learning platforms assess student engagement in real-time.
Marketing & Retail: Determines customer interest while interacting with products or advertisements.
Human-Computer Interaction: Improves AI-driven systems by detecting user engagement levels.
Driver Monitoring: Detects drowsiness and lack of attention in drivers.
