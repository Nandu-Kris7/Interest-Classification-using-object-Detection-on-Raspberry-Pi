# Interest-Classification-using-object-Detection-on-Raspberry-Pi
 This project analyzes human behavior to classify a person's interest level—"Interested" or "Not Interested"—using computer vision and machine learning on a Raspberry Pi. The system leverages OpenCV, MediaPipe, and TensorFlow Lite to detect facial expressions, eye gaze, and body posture in real time.
